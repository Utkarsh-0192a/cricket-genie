[16:39:56] [DEBUG] Generated final response: Okay, I'm ready to help you create a strong Dream11 team for IPL match 25 tomorrow. To give you the *best* team, I need a little more information!  Please tell me:

1.  **Which two teams are playing in IPL match 25?** (e.g., CSK vs. MI)
2.  **What is the venue for the match?** (e.g., Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai)

Once I have this information, I can provide a data-driven Dream11 team.

In the meantime, here's a general strategy and template you can start with:

**General Dream11 Strategy for IPL:**

*   **Team Composition**: Aim for a balance. 3-5 Batsmen, 1-2 Wicket-keepers, 1-3 All-rounders, and 3-5 Bowlers.
*   **Captain Choice**: Crucial!  Choose a player likely to score big (e.g., a top-order batsman in good form or a strike bowler).
*   **Vice-Captain Choice**: Slightly less risky than Captain. An all-rounder is often a good choice.
*   **Recent Form is Key**: Don't just rely on reputation. Look at the last 3-5 matches.
*   **Pitch Report Matters**: Batting-friendly?  Pace bowlers get assistance?  Spinners?
*   **Death Bowlers are Gold**: Bowlers who bowl in the final overs are more likely to take wickets.

**Example Dream11 Team Structure (Waiting for Match Details):**

*   **Wicket-keepers (1-2):** Player A (Credit: 9), Player B (Credit: 8.5)
*   **Batsmen (3-5):** Player C (Credit: 10), Player D (Credit: 9.5), Player E (Credit: 8), Player F (Credit 7.5)
*   **All-rounders (1-3):** Player G (Credit: 10.5), Player H (Credit: 9)
*   **Bowlers (3-5):** Player I (Credit: 9), Player J (Credit: 8.5), Player K (Credit: 8), Player L (Credit: 7)

**Important Considerations When I Have Match Details:**

*   **Top Order Batsmen:** Prioritize players who bat in the top 3, especially if the pitch is good for batting.
*   **Powerplay Bowlers:** Bowlers who bowl in the powerplay overs can get early wickets.
*   **All-rounders Value:** All-rounders who bat in the top 6 and bowl 2-4 overs are incredibly valuable.
*   **Credit Management:** Be smart with your credits. Don't load up on too many expensive players. Look for value picks (7-8 credits) who can perform.

**Once you provide the team names and venue, I will give you a specific Dream11 team with Captain/Vice-Captain suggestions!** üèè

**Match Overview: CSK vs MI Fantasy Cricket Strategy**

Given MI's current form and CSK's struggles, here's how to approach your Dream11 team:

    *   **Wicket-keepers (1):**
        *   **Ishan Kishan (MI):** Good form and aggressive at the top.
    *   **Batsmen (3-4):**
        *   **Rohit Sharma (MI):** Mentioned focusing on simple things, good sign.
        *   **Suryakumar Yadav (MI):** Key MI batter, potential match-winner.
        *   **Ruturaj Gaikwad (CSK):** CSK's consistent performer; must-have.
        *   *Optional: Shivam Dube (CSK): If playing, power hitter.*
    *   **All-rounders (2-3):**
        *   **Hardik Pandya (MI):** Captaincy and all-round value.
        *   **Ravindra Jadeja (CSK):** Crucial for CSK in both departments.

        *   **Jasprit Bumrah (MI):** Excellent form; wicket-taking threat.
        *   **Matheesha Pathirana (CSK):** Death bowling specialist.
        *   *Optional: Gerald Coetzee (MI): If playing, can provide pace and wickets*

*   **Captain/Vice-Captain Choices:**

*   **Form Analysis:**

    *   **MI:** Rohit, SKY, and Bumrah are in good touch.
    *   **CSK:** Gaikwad is the most consistent. Jadeja can contribute with both bat and ball.

*   **Risk Assessment:**

    *   **Safe Picks:** Gaikwad, Bumrah, SKY, Jadeja
