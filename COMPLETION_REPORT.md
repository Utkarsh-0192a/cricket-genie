- ✅ Content extraction from first successful URL
- ✅ AI-powered response generation using extracted context

#### 2. **Chat History Integration**
- ✅ Context-aware conversation using previous messages
- ✅ Intelligent search query generation based on chat history
- ✅ Response generation using conversation context
- ✅ Automatic history management (keeps last 10 exchanges)

#### 3. **Professional Logging System**
- ✅ Structured logging with different components (api, search, extraction, ai, error, warn)
- ✅ Replaced all console.log statements with proper logger
- ✅ Formatted timestamps and JSON output
- ✅ Debug level logging enabled for development

#### 4. **Enhanced Search Functionality**
- ✅ Fixed DuckDuckGo search to return cricket websites instead of Google URLs
- ✅ URL filtering to exclude search engine results
- ✅ Reliable fallback URL system (Cricbuzz, ESPNCricinfo, IPL, BCCI, ICC)
- ✅ First-successful-extraction strategy with proper browser cleanup

#### 5. **Advanced Bot Detection Bypass** 🔥
- ✅ **BotBypass class** with session fingerprinting and cookie management
- ✅ **Dynamic User-Agent generation** with realistic browser fingerprints
- ✅ **Comprehensive header generation** (Chrome/Firefox-specific, security headers)
- ✅ **Human-like delay patterns** with jitter, variance, and reading simulation
- ✅ **Rate limiting detection** with automatic extended delays
- ✅ **TLS fingerprinting bypass** with realistic cipher suites
- ✅ **Request history tracking** and behavioral pattern simulation
- ✅ **Proxy support infrastructure** ready for rotation
- ✅ **Multiple result selectors** to handle DuckDuckGo structure changes
- ✅ **Batch processing** with limited concurrency to avoid detection

#### 6. **Streaming Responses Implementation** 🚀
- ✅ **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** streaming endpoint
- ✅ **Real-time text generation** using Gemini's streaming API
- ✅ **Frontend streaming handler** with chunk-by-chunk display
- ✅ **Visual streaming indicators** with cursor animation
- ✅ **Fallback to non-streaming** for compatibility
- ✅ **Error handling** for streaming interruptions
- ✅ **Chat history integration** with streaming responses

#### 7. **Content Extraction Improvements**
- ✅ Fixed browser initialization with proper error handling
- ✅ Reduced retry attempts from 3 to 2 as requested
- ✅ Enhanced initialization validation to prevent null errors
- ✅ Proper browser cleanup and resource management

#### 8. **Frontend Enhancements**
- ✅ **Streaming text display** with typewriter effect
- ✅ **Visual streaming indicators** (blinking cursor)
- ✅ **Smooth text appearance** animations
- ✅ **Chat history persistence** between messages
- ✅ **Error handling** for streaming failures
- ✅ **Beautiful modern UI** with IPL theming
